## Introduction

This project aims to implement and optimize Haar Machine Learning model for Face recognition application
I would like to thank OpenCV library for helping me implement the model.

## Running scripts

Face Detection : _python face_detect.py [nameOfYourPictureFile]_

Live Cam: _python webcam_detect.py_
